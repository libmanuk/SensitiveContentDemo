# SensitiveContentDemo

This repository holds files offered up as a demonstration.  Here is a simple approach to implementing an Instagram-like sensitive content warning for images on an HTML page.  This demonstration uses hard coded metadata for a single image file.  Within a Web Publishing Platform, this filter would be set to loop through sets of metadata for image files found via searching.
